# Bank Statement Data Extraction and Organization

## Description
In this project, I extracted data from a 194-page company bank statement and organized it into a structured Excel spreadsheet. The objective was to create an accurate and navigable financial record for tracking transactions.

- Utilized a bank statement converter tool to transform unstructured data from each page into structured tables.
- Ensured the accuracy of 1,500+ entries by cross-checking with the original bank statement.
- Organized data into clear columns for better readability and future use.
